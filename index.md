## Conventions

### The Flood
- When players are in a stall situation, they may stall by giving a clue that touches 2 or more trash cards on another player instead of hard burning or filling in or saving a random card on chop.
- Flooding a player’s hand with trash empowers them with the ability to trash order chop move.

<br />

### The Naughty Priority (3p only maybe, only for reverses)
- Players know that blindplays should only be deferred in exceptional circumstances: emergency situations and/or to perform a good finesse.
- However, players may also defer a blindplay in order to perform a priority in situations where the deferral will not cause the clue-receiver to bomb. 

#### [Example 1](https://hanab.live/replay/422830#18):


<img src="https://github.com/piper0/Hanab-Conventions/blob/main/naughty1.png?raw=true" width="750">

- Zamiel clues brown to micerang n4. 
- micerang gives 3 to kimbifille to focus b3.
- kimbifille knows that Zamiel expects her to blindplay n3 to demonstrate that brown to micerang was not a save clue. Nevertheless, she defers the blindplay to play b3.
- Zamiel knows that blindplays may only be deferred under exceptional circumstances. He also trusts that kimbifille is not making a mistake. 
- Zamiel blindplays slot 1. Once b4 is played, everyone knows that Zamiel has been priority finessed.
- micerang marks his slot5 card as n4 and will play it once n3 plays.

#### [Example 2](https://hanab.live/replay/369576#32):

<img src="https://github.com/piper0/Hanab-Conventions/blob/main/naughty2.png?raw=true" width="750">

- pianoblook clues 4 to kimbifille’s i2 as a reverse fake pink finesse on piper’s a3.
- piper knows that pianoblook expects him to blindplay a3. Nevertheless, he defers the blindplay to play r5. 
- pianoblook knows that blindplays may only be deferred under exceptional circumstances. He also trusts that piper is not making a mistake. 
- pianoblook blindplays slot 1. Once b2 plays, everyone knows that pianoblook has been priority bluffed.
- kimbifille knows she holds ‘a4’ and that piper’s a3 is gotten.

#### [Example 3](https://hanab.live/replay/318218#23):

<img src="https://github.com/piper0/Hanab-Conventions/blob/main/naughty3.png?raw=true" width="750">

- kimbifille clues 3 to piper’s r3 as a reverse layered finesse on piano’s r2.
- pianoblook knows that kimbifille expects him to blindplay to demonstrate that piper’s 3 is not i3. Nevertheless, he defers to play his globally known b4.
- kimbifille knows about the Naughty Priority Finesse. She plays her leftmost 5.
- piper knows that kimbifille has been priority finessed. He marks his 3 as not i3.

<br />

### The Hurricane Discard (4p+ only)
- If Alice discards known trash instead of playing a card, they must have a good reason to do so. If the team was at zero clues, this may simply be a Generation Discard. Otherwise, this is normally a Shout Discard.
- However, what if the team already had at least one clue, *and* the next player also has at least one known trash?
- Under these circumstances, Alice may actually be ‘Forecasting a Hurricane.’
- For a Hurricane to be forming, Bob must see playable cards on all of the remaining teammates’ first finesse positions. If so, he should discard his own trash as normal and see if the Hurricane occurs.
- On Cathy’s turn, she can now be promised that she is in the midst of a Hurricane as long as she sees a playable on everyone’s first finesse (excluding Alice’s, of course). Therefore, everyone can safely blind-play.
- For example, in a 4 player game:
  - All 1s are played, the team has 4 clues.
  - Alice has a fully known playable, plus known trash. Bob, Cathy, and Donald all have (unclued) playable 2s on first finesse.
  - Alice discards instead of playing her known g2. 
  - Bob considers this could be a Shout, but also sees that this could be a Forecast. Therefore, Bob also discards and sees what will happen.
  - Cathy now knows that this is indeed a Hurricane: she blind-plays b2.
  - Donald follows suit and blind-plays y2.
  - When it’s Bob’s turn, he plays what was his slot 1 at the time (r2).

<br />

### The Unnecessary Rank Choice Play Clue
- If a player has free choice between rank and color for a direct play clue and chooses rank, the clue-giver must be trying to communicate something extra.
- The clue-giver is promising Bob that he has exactly the clued card on first finesse (or third finesse if necessary for a UTD). 
- After Bob plays the card, Cathy will mark her clued card as trash. If the clue was unnecessary, Cathy will then respond accordingly.

#### [Example](https://hanab.live/replay/419646#23)

<img src="https://github.com/piper0/Hanab-Conventions/blob/main/urcpc.png?raw=true" width="750">

- pianoblook clues 1 to piper.
- Zamiel sees that pianoblook had free choice of color or rank but chose color.
- Zamiel blind-plays slot 1 as exactly g1. piper marks his 1 as trash and blind-plays slot 1 as an Unnecessary Trash Push.

<br />

### The Trash Shadow
- If Alice gives a 1-for-1 play clue to Bob’s third finesse position when there is a UTD target available in Cathy’s hand, Alice must be trying to communicate something extra.
- Bob should recognize that this is suboptimal – Alice should be filling Cathy’s hand with Known Trash to allow for safer discards and more potential Trash Order Chop Move opportunities.
- In this situation, the player giving the clue intends for the next player to blind-play from the finesse position that matches the true finesse position of Cathy’s leftmost trash.
- Note that because the clued card is always cleanly clueable, the declined UTD is always unnecessary. Cathy therefore marks the shadowed card as trash and chop moves or pushes in response.

<br />

### The Unknown Trash Blast (UTB) (3p only)
- If Alice touches a single unknown trash one away from chop in Cathy’s hand, the clue does not add more positive information to previously clued cards in her hand, and Cathy’s chop is also trash, Alice must be trying to communicate something extra.
- Bob sees that Alice could have instead clued Cathy’s chop as a Trash Push Discharge, which would get a single blind-play from Bob and give Cathy two Known Trash.
- Because Alice chose a line which gives Cathy only one Known Trash, Bob recognizes this as a suboptimal trash move.
- Bob should play his fifth finesse position to demonstrate to Cathy that her clued card and her chop are both trash.

<br />

### The Wail Discard
- First, see the section on the *[Scream Discard](https://hanabi.github.io/docs/level-6#the-scream-discard-chop-move-sdcm)*.
- A Wail Discard Chop Move is done only as the last resort. 
- When Cathy has 3 critical cards on chop and there is no way for Alice and Bob to save all three, Alice may discard. 
- The Wail Discard is characterized by its ‘earliness’. It can be done in the early game before extinguishing all play/save clues. As well, it can be done when Cathy expects Alice to be cluing something in Bob’s hand. 
- Since Wail Discards are only done as the last resort, the move must have some other meaning. This sends the signal to Cathy that there is something very wrong.
- If Bob gives her a save clue, Cathy will know to chop move twice. If Bob also discards, then Cathy will know to chop move thrice. 

<br />

### The Ghostly Finesse
- First, see the section on the *[Wail Discard](#the-wail-discard)*.
- A Wail Discard is only performed as the last resort.
- But what if Cathy actually only has 2 critical cards on chop that could be saved by 2 clues from Alice and Bob?
- In this case - Bob must respond to the ‘Wail’ by playing his finesse position to indicate to Cathy that Alice’s discard was not a Wail, but instead a ‘Ghostly Wail’, indicated by the blind play.

<br />

### The Poltergeist (AKA Ghostly Ejection)
- First, see the sections on the *[Wail Discard](#the-wail-discard)* and the *[Ghostly Finesse](#the-ghostly-finesse)*.
- But what if Cathy has 4 criticals on chop and - while in the same situation that all 4 cannot be clued by both Alice and Bob?
- Sometimes the Wail Discard is sufficient if the save clue on chop also touches the other critical card. But if this situation is not possible, Bob must indicate the number of chop moves for Cathy.
- Since Cathy would only chop move twice due to a clue to her chop, Bob must instead play his second finesse position to indicate that it is not a normal Wail Discard, and it is also not a Ghostly Finesse.

<br />

### The Lady’s Discard

First, see the section on the *[Gentleman's Discard](https://hanabi.github.io/docs/level-9/#the-gentlemans-discard)* and the *[Layered Gentleman’s Discard](https://hanabi.github.io/docs/level-9/#the-layered-gentlemans-discard)*.
- To review, when a player discards a clued card that is known to them, they are promising that the other copy is on the board.
- The Lady’s Discard breaks that promise. It trades one known clued card to signal to the whole team to blind-play.

- It would be very strange for Alice to discard a known clued card when the other copy of the card is not visible on the board from her seat. This is a signal to the team that something special is happening.
- As Bob does not see the other copy on the board, he believes that Alice has transferred the card to him. Bob blind-plays his first finesse position.  
- Cathy sees that Bob doesn’t have the card in his hand. Cathy also knows that Bob believes he is layered and he will play his second finesse position next. 
- Cathy knows that Alice could not have intended for Bob to bomb. Cathy blind-plays her first finesse position to signal to the team that nobody has the second copy.
- Donald sees that Bob and Cathy both blind-played. He knows he does not have the second copy. He also knows that there are many ways for Alice to get two cards to blind-play without discarding a known clued card. This move is always unnecessary and calls for something more.
- In response, Donald blind-plays.

<br />

### The Lady’s Morning-After-Discard (MAD)
- First, see the section on The *[Lady’s Discard](#the-ladys-discard)*.
- If Cathy sees that Bob doesn’t have the promised second copy of Alice’s discarded card, she will know that Alice was trying to perform a Lady’s Discard.
- However, if Bob’s whole hand is playable, Cathy should not blindplay.
- If nobody responds to tell Bob something strange is going on, Bob will continue to dig for the second copy and play his whole hand.
- The team will have effectively purged Bob’s hand.

<br />

### The Dumpster Fire [Blazing Dumptruck]
- Usually, when someone performs a Distributed Dump Truck, it promises that everyone has a playable on their First Finesse Position.
- But what if Bob sees that this cannot be the case, based on his teammates’ hands?
- In this case, Bob should trust that this is actually a Dumpster Fire (i.e. a Blazing Dumptruck) - he should trust Alice and blind-play the matching Finesse Position, thus signaling for all his teammates’ to follow suit!

<br />

### The Ricochet (4p+ only)
- First, see the section on *[Dumpster Fires](#the-dumpster-fire-blazing-dumptruck)*.
- If Alice bombs her chop and Bob sees that it cannot be a Dump Truck or a Dumpster Fire, Bob should next check for an available Ricochet.
- In a Ricochet, instead of all players playing the same finesse position, the finesse position will increment or decrement with each player. Players should continue incrementing or decrementing until they reach the first or last finesse position, at which point they should swap directions.
- For example, in a 5p game:
  - Alice bombs her chop.
  - Bob first checks for a Dump Truck. He can see that Cathy’s first finesse is unplayable, so this cannot be a Dump Truck.
  - Bob then checks for a Dumpster Fire. Cathy’s third finesse is playable, but only Donald’s fourth finesse is playable, so this cannot be a Dumpster Fire.
  - Bob then checks for a Ricochet.
  - Cathy’s third finesse is playable.
  - Donald’s fourth finesse is playable.
  - Emily’s third finesse is playable.
  - Bob therefore plays his second finesse position.
  - Cathy sees that this cannot be a Dumpster Fire and therefore checks for a Ricochet. She sees that if she plays her third finesse position, Donald will know to decrement the played finesse position one further. Emily will know to increment the played finesse position afterwards.

#### Example:

<img src="https://github.com/piper0/Hanab-Conventions/blob/main/rocochet.png?raw=true" width="400">

- No cards are played on the stacks.
- griff77 bombs chop.
- Cynas first checks for a Dump Truck. Bot-Fiora’s first finesse cannot be playable, so Cynas rules this out.
- Cynas then checks for a Dumpster Fire. Bot-Fiora’s only playable card is on third finesse, but a Dumpster Fire would cause p2 to bomb.
- Cynas then checks for a Ricochet. He sees that if he plays second finesse, Bot-Fiora can play third finesse, timotree can play fourth finesse, and HelanaAshryvr can ricochet back to third finesse.
- After Cynas plays second finesse, Bot-Fiora checks to see if it’s a Dumpster Fire. If she plays second finesse, timotree will bomb b4, so she rules out the Dumpster Fire.
- Bot-Fiora then checks for a Ricochet. If she plays first finesse, timotree will bomb b4 from second finesse. If she plays third finesse, timotree will play g2. Because g2 is one-away-from-playable and this is the only explanation for griff77 and Cynas’s blind-plays, Bot-Fiora blind-plays third finesse as exactly g1.
- Timotree and HelanaAshryvr go on to play fourth and third finesse to complete the Ricochet.

<br />

### The Frostbite blind-play (for 5’s)
- If a player is in a valid Stalling situation and a 5 Stall (or Save) is available, the [Allowable Stall Clue](https://hanabi.github.io/docs/level-8/#allowable-stall-clues-stall-table) table disallows them from performing other less valuable Stalls.
- Thus, we already agree that a lower priority Stall in such a situation should mean something extra.
- Therefore, if instead Alice performs an ‘illegal’ Hard Burn, Bob can trust he is being called to blind-play some card.
- In normal situations this might look like a Poke Ignition or Poke Ejection, but via Occam’s Razor this special circumstance is actually calling for something much more straightforward: a Frostbite blind-play.
- In order to perform a Frostbite,  the next player must blind-play the matching Finesse Position of the left-most 5 that could have been used to perform the 5 Stall.
- After a Frostbite occurs, the (left-most) 5 will be globally known and therefore successfully ‘frozen’.

<br />

### The DOUT (Doubt)

In some variants where tempo is important, getting many plays in a row from different slots can be invaluable. Often there are two playables on finesse position of different players, but a third playable card not on finesse - but instead in discharge position. If a double bluff is available, the players can at least get the two finesse position cards played - but what if the card used for the double bluff is actually trash AND the player clued the trash is the first to respond to the double bluff?

In this case - players should trust that Alice knows what she is doing and not DOUT (doubt) her that this is a double bluff out of position unknown trash discharge (D = db, O = oop, UT = unknown trash).

#### [Example](https://hanab.live/replay/443291#11)

<img src="https://github.com/piper0/Hanab-Conventions/blob/main/dout.png?raw=true" width="750">

- ADrone clues 4s to Kimbi, initiating a finesse or bluff for green 4 (from Kimbi’s perspective). 
- Kimbi plays into the bluff and plays null 1 successfully.
- Piano now must respond as though it is a 4 double bluff with green 4 by playing finesse position as well (null 2), as there is no action Piano can take to inform kimbi that the 4 is trash without wasting another clue.
- Piper must now discharge as an unknown trash discharge to indicate to Kimbi that the clued 4 was actually a trash card and successfully play null 3.

<br />

### The Alakazam
- When a Alice gives a clue that would normally be an Ejection, Discharge, Charm, etc, and Bob doesn't have a corresponding *n*-th finesse position, it usually means an OOP Ejection, Discharge, etc. is intended. But what if Bob can see that no OOP interpretation makes sense?
- Bob should then just blind-play from the wraparound slot in a fashion similar to The Bubblegum Wraparound.
- Alice should be careful to only give such a clue when it will be obvious to everybody what is going on, of course.

<br />

### The Flamethrower Pass-Blaze
- If a Blaze Discard occurs, Bob is *always* promised to have a playable card on the matching Finesse Position.
- However, if Bob sees that Cathy *also* has a playable on the matching finesse, he can effectively “pass” the Blaze Discard to Cathy.
- After the ‘pass’, Cathy must *also* be promised a matching card and, therefore, must immediately play it.
- This should also work in other Ignition-style clues, such as *Double Ignitions* and *Shadow Finesses*.
- **NOTE**: This should never be attempted by discarding an unknown card, since you very actively do not have permission to discard! 

<br />

### Tinder Ejection
- First, see the section on *[Ignitions](https://hanabi.github.io/docs/level-23/#unnecessary-moves-with-known-trash----ignition)*.
- Currently, ignitions can be on anyone. This gives us the option for clues where an out of position ignition is declined without any good reason, calling Bob to blind play to tell the team that an extra ignition should have been given. 
- Consider the following situation:
  - All 2s are played.
    - Bob:    x r3 x x
    - Cathy:  b3 x x x
    - Donald: x x g3 r1
  - Alice clues green to Donald, as an ordinary play clue on g3. 
  - Bob sees that ordinarily Alice would clue 1 to Donald instead, as an out of position unnecessary trash push that asks Cathy to play b3. 
  - Therefore Alice means something extra, and Bob plays his second slot as a Tinder Ejection. 
  - Now Cathy sees that if green was a normal play clue, it should not cause an extra blind play from slot 2, and if she doesn't respond it looks like a 5CE.
  - Therefore she plays her finesse position as an ignition.

(This proposal would also make sense with Bob playing slot 1 himself, but there's a conflict with double bluffs then - the ejection slot is less overloaded. There is a very clean and simple extension to odd/even unnecessary trash pushes in case slot 1 is called for though, so you could have a declined declined unnessary trash push then.)

It's called a Tinder Ejection, because it helps to 'light the fire' of Cathy's ignition. An alternative name could be the Spark Ejection.

<br />

### The Squeeze Finesse
- When a rank clue touches a 2+ away card, this typically promises either a true finesse or a double bluff.
- However, what if the clue touches two 2+ away cards with exactly one untouched card between them. In this case, the clue-giver must be trying to communicate something extra.
- In response, the clue-receiver should blind-play the card between the clued cards.

#### [Example 1](https://hanab.live/replay/261407#3)

<img src="https://github.com/piper0/Hanab-Conventions/blob/main/squeeze1.png?raw=true" width="750">

- joelwool clues two 5s to Animex52.
- Because no 3s have been played, Animex52 sees that these 5s must be 2+ away from playable.
- Animex52 therefore plays the card between the 5s.

#### [Example 2 – The squeeze patch finesse](https://hanab.live/replay/319234#6)

<img src="https://github.com/piper0/Hanab-Conventions/blob/main/squeeze2.png?raw=true" width="750">

- pianoblook clues 4 to kimbifille, newly touching two 4s with one unclued card between them.
- piper can see that g2 will bomb as a squeeze finesse.
- Therefore, piper patches by playing g1. kimbifille then plays g2.

<br />

### The Inevitable Finesse
- Before the game begins, in an *n*-player game, the *n*th player agrees to blind-play his/her third finesse position on his/her second turn.
- If successful, this is a free 1-for-0!
- The rest of the team therefore has two rounds to either:
  - Make his/her third finesse position playable.
  - Prevent the blind-play.
- To prevent the blind-play, either:
  - Touch enough cards in the player’s hand to ensure that s/he does not have a third finesse position on his/her second turn.
  - Force the player to blind-play a different finesse position on his/her second card (such as a bluff or an ejection).

<br />

### The Priority Positional
- The *Priority Finesse/Bluff* is one of the leading causes of mistakes and desync in H-Live Conventions. Therefore, we propose the following new priority system.
- Players are *always* expected to play their playable cards from left to right, regardless of the identity of the card. This is an easy to remember rule, and deviations from this pattern will be easy to spot.
- If Alice plays a card other than the leftmost playable card, this is to be interpreted as a positional clue, much like the *Positional Discard*.
- This positional clue can be on anyone – if Alice plays slot 3 out of priority and Bob can see a playable on Cathy's slot 3, Bob should NOT respond.
